<msg type="warning" file="NgdBuild" num="0" delta="new" >The value of SIM_DEVICE on instance &apos;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">vga_top_i/char_rom_i/BRAM_MEM_I/B6/RAMB16BWER</arg>&apos; of type <arg fmt="%s" index="2">RAMB16BWER</arg> has been changed from &apos;<arg fmt="%s" index="3">SPARTAN3ADSP</arg>&apos; to &apos;<arg fmt="%s" index="4">SPARTAN6</arg>&apos; to correct post-ngdbuild and timing simulation for this primitive.  In order for functional simulation to be correct, the value of SIM_DEVICE should be changed in this same manner in the source netlist or constraint file.
